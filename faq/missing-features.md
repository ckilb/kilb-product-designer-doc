# I need feature XY but the product designer does not have it. What should I do?

The product designer is a huge plugin with a lot of functionality that hopefully cover your use cases as well.
Still there's a good chance of course that you have specific requirements that are not fulfilled by the designer.

The product designer will be extended and improved in frequent intervals. If there's some functionality that is missing from your point of view 
don't hesitate to contact our [support](/support.html) and tell us. We may are already working on that feature or could give you a hint if there's another way to reach the goal.

There's no guarantee a feature you need will be implemented though.
In that case you - or someone who has the technical skills - could [customize and extend the product designer](/customizations/index.html) to your needs.
