# Is it possible for my customers to add multiple product variants (i.e. sizes) at once?

In some cases you m ay want to offer your customers to add multiple product variants at once.
For example, if you sell T-Shirts in different sizes (S, M, L) your customers might want to create
one single design and add the T-Shirt with several sizes into the cart (for example 3x S, 4x M, 2x L).

Unfortunately this is not the scope of the product designer's implementation, so you have to install another plugin
for that kind of functionality.

If you use Shopware, we strongly recommend _Variants table_ (in German: _Varianten als Tabelle_). It's
a great plugin which got tested carefully together with the Product Designer.

You can find a demo here:
