## Version 2

The second major version of KILB Product Designer will be a big update introduce a lot of improvements - especially for developers.

### What's new?

#### Source Code Available
- The source code of the Frontend & Backend implementation is now available for all our customers
- Add your own plugins & compile a custom build of the designer

#### Improved UI & Design
- Now built with Tailwind CSS for rapid UX & UI development
- A more clean and intuitive design

#### Add images with a single button
- Simplified UX: There's just one button to add/upload images

#### No API key required
- No need to enter an API key anymore
- Shopware's API authentication will be used instead 

#### Improved customizability
- Custom JS/CSS via configurations is still supported and recommended for most customers
- Custom JS can now access Vue.js store for even better customizability
- If you want to make deeper changes to the compiler you can now implement your own plugins and compile the designer for yourself. 


#### Better API Communication
- Communication with shop server will now use GraphQL protocol
- This means less requests and a standardized way of communication

#### Updated Dependencies
All the JavaScript dependencies were updated to it's newest version, most notably:
- fabric.JS: from version 3 to version 5
- Vue.js: from version 2 to version 3, using Composition API now
  Code Cleanup
- Strict code style rules were added and will be automatically checked by ESLint
- Vue.js components were splitted into many and are now way more light weight
- New business code layer to share logic between components

#### Automated tests
- Integrated Cypress.io for automated acceptance tests

### Migration from Version 1

If you just use the designer without any customizations for JavaScript or CSS
you most likely can update the designer without any manual todos.
__Still, because the Product Designer is a highly configurable plugin you should save some time for the next update to test if everything is working as expected.__ 

If you added custom JavaScript or CSS you have to adjust that - version 2 will break backwards compatibility here.
The basic idea of these customization technology is still 
the same - so migrating shouldn't be too hard - still some things have changed.

#### CSS selectors

In version 1 a lot of elements had CSS selectors which you could use to overwrite the style.
In version 2 [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used to style the elements. Therefore CSS
class names have no semantic meaning and can't be used to identify HTML elements anymore.

Instead all the HTML templates in the designer are splitted in small Vue.JS components and every component's
root HTML tag has - by convention - an attribute `data-component`.
So if you like to overwrite some CSS style you can use this attribute.

As an example: To add a red background color to the QR code button the code had to be like this:
````css
.open-modal-qr-code { background-color: red; }
````

For version 2 your CSS code has to similar to this:
````css
[data-component="action.action-button"] {
  background-color:red;
}
````

The new way is much more consistent and - if you use these to style your elements - compatibility for future
updates of the Product Designer is improved.

#### JS store

In version 1 you were able to retrieve the `canvas` and `configuration` object via
`window.productDesigner.onCanvasInitialized`.
Additionally you were able to find out if the user switched the configuration via `window.productDesigner.onConfigurationSwitched`.

While this implementation was sufficient for most of our clients there are two disadvantages:
* It's not possible to retrieve other objects like canvas zoom, fonts or (background) images.
* Providing this functionality was additional code in the designer source code to take care about: When the source code of the designer was changed there was additional overhead in testing the customization functionality.

That's why in version 2 both methods, `onCanvasInitialized` and `onConfigurationSwitched` were removed.
Instead, you are now able to access the same store object that is used by the designer for all the data that have to be shared between different Vue.JS components.

As an example: In version 1 you were able add an fabric.JS event similar to this:

````javascript
window.productDesigner.onCanvasInitialized = function (configuration, canvas) {
  canvas.on('object:added', (event) => {
    if (configuration.name = 'name to filter for') {
        // do something
    }
  })
};
````

In version it will work like this:

````javascript
const store = window.productDesigner.store;

window.productDesigner.watch(store.hasActiveCanvas(), (isActiveCanvasExisting) => {
    if (!isActiveCanvasExisting) {
      const canvas = store.activeCanvas().value;

      canvas.on('object:added', (event) => {
        if (configuration.name = 'name to filter for') {
          // do something
        }
      });
    }
});
````

Please mind: A lot of the objects inside `window.productDesigner.store` are `refs`. So you have to
use it's property `value` to get the actual value. Read more about this here:
https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/reactivity-fundamentals.html#reactive-variables-with-ref


`window.productDesigner.watch` is just a wrapper function around Vue.js watch. You can use it for all `ref` objects to listen
for changes. More about this here: https://vuejs.org/api/reactivity-core.html#watch
