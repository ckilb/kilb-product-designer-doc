# Support

If you have an active subscription for the plugin you are eligible for contacting our *official support*.

Before contacting the support we kindly ask you to make sure you read our [FAQ](/faq/index.html) - your question may already be answered there!
Please also make sure that you read & understood all the *configuration fields*. Under each configuration field you will find
a small help text explaining to you the purpose of that field. It's crucial to understand how to configure the designer to use it. 

The best way to get the product designer running and working the way you like is to play around with it after you installed it.
Create and edit some configurations and see how it will change the look and behavior of the designer for your customers.
Because there are a lot of configuration options this may take some time but it's fun and worth it!

If you still have questions or you think you found a bug feel free to contact us. You can do this by using the official
support ticket system provided by Shopware or WooCommerce. 

Please don't write us an E-Mail directly as we are not easily able to check if you are actually eligible for our *official support*.
